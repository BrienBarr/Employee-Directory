## Description

This application allows a user to view the entire employee directory (populated with info from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/)) at once so that he/she has quick access to the employees' non-sensitive information.  The user is able to filter the employees by first or last name.  In addition, the user can sort the entire employee list or the filtered employee list by the employees' last name, email, or location in ascending or descending order.
